### Introduction

[TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) is a lightweight document oriented database optimized for your happiness :) The target are small apps that would be blown away by a SQL-DB or an external database server.

But in this project, it's written in pure Golang and has no external dependencies.
